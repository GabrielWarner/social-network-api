## Description
In this application I built a backend API that mocks a social media website that lets you create a User and add thoughts to that user which would in comparison to creating a post on a social media site. You also have the ability to add reactions to thoughts which are mimiking comments on a social media post. In this application I used Express to build the API routes and Mongoose to setup the database and build schemas for the Models.
